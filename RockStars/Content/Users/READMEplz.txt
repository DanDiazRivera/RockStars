Hello! 
Before beginning work, please ensure you are currently on your branch.

**Before changing any files, be sure to duplicate what you want to work on 
and put it in the folder with your name on it.
Once in your folder, you may make all the changes you like to the duplicated file.
Using duplicates ensures we are not all working on the same file, which would cause conflicts.

Thank you for reading, have fun!
